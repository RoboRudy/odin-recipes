    <img src="../images/Ribeye.jpg" alt="Ribeye steak. Enough said.">
    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sizzling, steaming, smoking meat
    Always a tasty, yummy treat.
    Some prefer it pink, others love it brown.
    Long as I remember, its always been around.
    Grass to cow; cow to plate
    Eat it with a pretty girl on a date
    Salad, potatoes, lots of sides
    Eating too much makes an uncomfortable ride.
    Summertime, cookout, they're on the way
    Friends plus me and steak, GREAT DAY!</p>
<p>What more needs to be said?</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>6 (8 ounce) rib-eye steaks</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Two days before cooking, salt both sides of each steak with 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt per steak. Place steaks in an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
    <li>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides of steak with black pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat cast iron pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Add vegetable oil and heat until oil shimmers.</li>
    <li>Carefully place steaks in pan. Cook until brown and hard-seared on one side, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn steaks and top with one teaspoon butter. Cook for 3 to 4 more minutes or to desired doneness. You may need to cook the steaks in batches depending on the size of your cast iron pan. Keep the cooked steaks in a 170 degree F oven until ready to serve.</li>
</ol>
